I am a Master of Business (Data Analytics for Business) student at Monash University with a background in Economics and Marketing.
My passion lies in using data not only to analyse the past, but also to shape strategies for the future.
I am particularly interested in how analytics can drive business development, uncover new opportunities, and support smarter, more sustainable growth.

Throughout my studies, I have explored a wide range of analytical approaches, from identifying key patterns in customer behaviour to building predictive models that inform decision-making.
I am currently enrolled in the Communicating with Data unit in my final semester, where I am developing skills in presenting insights through blogs, reports, and interactive dashboards, as well as crafting data stories that resonate with wider audiences.
These experiences strengthen my ability to transform complex information into clear, actionable narratives that add value beyond the numbers.

What motivates me most is the challenge of connecting data with real-world business goals.
I enjoy tackling questions that do not have straightforward answers and finding solutions that combine creativity with evidence.
I see data analytics as a bridge between detail-oriented research and strategic business thinking, and I aim to apply this mindset to projects that create meaningful impact across industries.

I have a strong perseverance that helps me stay committed even when challenges arise.
I pair this with adaptability and attention to detail, which allow me to approach problems with focus and curiosity.
Beyond my academic work, I enjoy exploring new tools, expanding my knowledge, and finding creative ways to use data as a driver for business development and problem-solving.
